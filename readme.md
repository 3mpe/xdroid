Xdroid - extensions library for any Android app.

**NOTE:** This library currently in development stage. I'm working on examples, unit-tests and documentation.

## Modules

- Adapter
- App
- Collections
- Core
- Custom Service
- Enum Format

## Gradle dependency

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.shamanland:xdroid:0.3.0'

In case if you need only one of modules use this pattern:

```
